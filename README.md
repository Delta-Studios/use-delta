## Usage
An example program that just prints the text "Hello world!":
```
puts 'Hello world!'
```
Functions can be created and called like this:
```
def myFunction
  puts 'Hello world!'
end

myFunction
```
Example for argument expecting functions:
```
def myFunction arg anotherArg
  puts 'Hello world!$n'+'anotherArg'
end

myFunction 'Arg1','Arg2'
```
Output:
```
Hello world!
Arg1
Arg2
```
